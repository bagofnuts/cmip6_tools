This contains the analysis scripts used to download, regrid and compress CMIP6 data

---------------------------------------
0. ESGF (earth system grid federation)

First create an account and take notes about your OpenID, login and password. These three information must be kept in close. 
Example: 
Data search engine is at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/
Login is required. Open ID is https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/esgf-idp/openid/yourusername
The passwd is yourpassword

1A. Use wget to download the data. 

Generate the wget script off of the download site. 
bash wget-XXXXX.sh -H https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/esgf-idp/openid/yourusername yourusername
Then enter password at the prompt. 
It will start downloading. However, when you are accessing a server through ssh, it stops when you close your laptop. 
So, here is a solution for batch-mode download. 

1B. Use wget in the batch mode on the pace cluster (recommended)

Generate the wget script off of the download site. 
Then copy the wget script to your scratch space. 
$ scp wget-xxxxx.sh yourusername@login-d.pace.gatech.edu:~/scratch/downloads/.
Then copy download.sh script to your scratch/download. 
Modify it and execute it to download in the batch-mode. 
All the scripts are located here. 

--------------------------------------------------
2. Regrid the model onto global 2x2 lon-lat grid. 

Copy cmip6_remap3d.pbs script to your scratch/download. 
Edit this file. 
    set MYDIR. 
    Adjust the number of CPUs if necessary. 
    Adjust #PBS -M youremail@gatech.edu
This allows you to execute the regridding in parallel mode
To execute type: 
$ msub cmip6_remap3d.pbs

--------------------------------------------------
3. Combine all fields into one file

Edit and execute the one_file.py
